### Tasker setup

To enable Kaori to send location-based weather updates, you need to set up Tasker on your mobile device:

1. **Download and Install Tasker:**
   - Install Tasker from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm).

2. **Create a New Task to Get Location:**
   - Open Tasker and navigate to the "Tasks" tab.
   - Click the `+` button to create a new task.
   - Name the task "GetLocation" and tap the checkmark.

3. **Add a Location Action:**
   - Click the `+` button inside the task and select "Location".
   - Set accuracy preferences as needed.
   - Add an action to "Variable Split" the retrieved location into separate latitude and longitude values.

4. **Store the Location in a JSON Format:**
   - Add a "Variable Set" action.
   - Name the variable `%JSON_BODY`.
   - Set its value to:
     ```json
     {
        "latitude": %LOCN1,
        "longitude": %LOCN2,
        "timestamp":"%TIME"
     }
     ```

5. **Send the Data to the Server:**
   - Add an "HTTP Request" action.
   - Set the method to `POST`.
   - In the "Server:Port" field, enter:
     ```
     http://<your-ip>:80 or 8080
     ```
   - Set the "Body" field to `%JSON_BODY`.

6. **Create a Profile for Recurring Location Updates:**
   - Go to the "Profiles" tab and click the `+` button.
   - Select "Time" and set it to trigger every `20` minutes.
   - Link this profile to the "GetLocation" task.

7. **Enable Tasker:**
   - Ensure Tasker is enabled so it runs in the background.

Now, Tasker will periodically send your location data to the Kaori server, allowing it to get to know more about you ;).
